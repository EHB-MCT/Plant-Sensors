### Installing/Starting server
* Clone this repository.

You have now 2 choices: Running the server with Docker (This will run all services) or just only the node server with nodejs.

**Running server with nodejs.**
1. Make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the folder `NodeServer/app/` with your terminal.
3. Execute this command to install all the node modules: `npm i`
4. Start the server with this command: `node index.js`

**Running server with docker**
1. Install docker and docker-compose on your machine.
2. Navigate to the folder `NodeServer` with your terminal.
3. Start the server with this command: `docker-compose up -d` if you want to run the container in the background or `docker-compose up` if you want to see the live logs (works only when you are in the same folder where the docker-compose.yaml file is located).

### Extra: Docker commands
If you are using docker to run the server, here are some usefull commands:
* `docker container ls` - See all your running containers.
* `docker attach fpnode` - Watch live logs of the fpnode docker container.
* `docker compose down` - If you want to terminate the docker containers that are running in the background (works only when you are in the same folder where the docker-compose.yaml file is located).
* To terminate the container when you are watching the live logs, press `ctrl + c`.
